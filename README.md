# Graph2Torch

Create flowcharts of neural networks and convert the flowcharts into PyTorch for inferencing/training.

## Project Prototyping Components

### Front-End (TBD)
- Flowchart Canvas with zoom in/out utility
- Menu for neural network layer blocks
- Draggable neural network layer blocks (To be dropped into the canvas)
- Arrows attach to the neural network layers blocks
- Data exchange with backend

### Back-End (Python)
- Graph To PyTorch code converter
- PyTorch inferencing/training utility
- Data exchange with frontend
